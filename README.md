# VELSYNC_VCD_03
This project implements a digital stopwatch using Verilog HDL. It supports start/stop toggle and reset operations and counts seconds from 0 to 59. A parameterized clock divider generates a 1 Hz pulse from the system clock. The design is fully synchronous, synthesizable, and verified using a testbench.
